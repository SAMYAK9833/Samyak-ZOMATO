## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps Zomato understand key metrics related to orders, amount, customer ratings, and city-wise performance. It provides insights into the type of food preferred, performance by year, and geographic distribution of order value, enabling strategic decisions for marketing, logistics, and restaurant partnerships.

It also provides an overview of different categories (Veg, Non-Veg, Other), and their respective performance in terms of sales and ratings, thus identifying food preferences and customer satisfaction trends over time.
